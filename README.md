Cmake helper modules help to create cross-compiled builds for AVR / STM32 / x86. The goal is to
reuse working solutions in different projects and minimize duplicate work such as:

* Setting up paths to source files and libraries
* Enabling of unit testing on x86 platform for embedded platform code 
* Re-typing boilerplate code around initialization and checks
